    "A number system is just a way people have decided to represent numbers.  Certain systems are better at certain tasks then other systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are used to using the **Decimal** Number System in your everyday life.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- The decimal number system has 10 digits (0 – 9)\n",
    "\n",
    "- I don’t have a good reason why that system was chosen a long time ago.  Likely due to ease of use, with some people saying its because we have 10 fingers / toes so it makes it easy to count. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Every number we use can be represented by those 10 digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "- These are called **Base 10** Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "With computer systems it is often easier to represent numbers with other types of number systems\n",
    "\n",
    "You have probably heard of the **Binary** Number System\n",
    "\n",
    "- Binary Numbers use two digits 0 and 1\n",
    "\n",
    "- Computers use electronic components that understand **on** and **off** states.  So having a 1 represent the on state, and the 0 represent the off state makes a lot of sense\n",
    "\n",
    "- These are called **Base 2** Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "Another number system that is used quite frequently in computer systems is the Hexadecimal Number System\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hexadecimal uses 16 digits (0-9,A-F) where the letters represent the decimal equivalents (A=10, B=11, C=12, D=13, E=14, F=15)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Although computers prefer binary, its difficult for humans to always communicate and understand long binary numbers. **Hexadecimal** provides a bit of a compromise.  It’s easy to convert to binary visually.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hexadecimal numbers are used in [HTML color codes](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/) and MAC addresses for devices on networks and memory address locations. \n",
