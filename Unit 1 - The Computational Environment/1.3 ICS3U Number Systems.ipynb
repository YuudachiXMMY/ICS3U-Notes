    "\n",
    "- The decimal number system has 10 digits (0 – 9)\n",

    "- I don’t have a good reason why that system was chosen a long time ago.  Likely due to ease of use, with some people saying its because we have 10 fingers / toes so it makes it easy to count. \n",

    "- Every number we use can be represented by those 10 digits.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Binary Numbers use two digits 0 and 1\n",

    "- Computers use electronic components that understand **on** and **off** states.  So having a 1 represent the on state, and the 0 represent the off state makes a lot of sense\n",

    "- Although computers prefer binary, its difficult for humans to always communicate and understand long binary numbers. **Hexadecimal** provides a bit of a compromise.  It’s easy to convert to binary visually.\n",
