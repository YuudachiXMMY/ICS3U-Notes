    "The bridge between hardware and software involves writing a **computer program** (set of instructions) that the hardware will execute\n",
    "\n",
    "A **programming language** is a set of instructions that translate a programmers intentions into a language that a machine can understand. Machines generally understand electrical currents being either on or off, so a binary system of 1’s and 0’s are used to communicate the on and off logic.\n",

    "\n",
    "A **high level language** is a programming language that enables a programmer to write programs that are more or less closer to human languages and further from machine languages. Programs that are written in a high level language have to be translated before they can run which is considered a small disadvantage. However, they are portable and can run on many different kinds of computers with few modifications. This is a very big advantage.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **low level language** is sometimes called an assembly language. They mostly deal a lot with specific memory locations, and hardware components that are specific to a certain piece of hardware. They are much harder to write code for. Low level programs can only run on one kind of computer and have to be rewritten to run on another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost all programs are now written in high level languages if possible. Regardless of using a high level language or a low level language, the instructions have to converted to a set of 1’s and 0’s so the machine can understand the logic. There are two ways to translate a program to machine code:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpreting\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reads a program and translates the program line by line. It reads a line of code then carries out its command before proceeding to the next line of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Compiling\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reads a program and translates the program all at once before running any of the commands\n",
