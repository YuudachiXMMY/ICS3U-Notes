    "\n",
    "We want to be able to create our own functions that accomplish very small and specific tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before a function can be usedd, it must be defined. That is, you define the rules of how the function will behave when used. – A function contains a **header** and a **body**\n",

    "- The **parameter** list consists of the data the function needs to perform the task. The list is formed by specifying a variable to hold the data sent to it \n",
