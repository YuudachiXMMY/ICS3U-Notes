# ICS3U Curriculum - Grade 11 Computer Science Course Outline

ICS3U introduces students to computer science. The ICS3U Curriculum will have Grade 11 Computer Science students design software independently and as part of a team, using industry-standard programming tools and applying the software development life-cycle model. They will also write and use subprograms within computer programs. ICS3U1 students will develop creative solutions for various types of problems as their understanding of the computing environment grows. They will also explore environmental and ergonomic issues, emerging research in computer science, and global career trends in computer-related fields.

Grade 11 Computer Science is about how computers compute.  It is not about learning how to use the computer, and it is much more than computer programming.  Computer studies is the study of ways of representing objects and processes.  It involves defining problems, analyzing problems, designing solutions, and developing, testing, and maintaining programs.  The major focus of the ICS3U Curriculum is the development of programming skills, which are important for success in future postsecondary studies. Introduction to Computer Science is relevant for all students because it incorporates a broad range of transferable problem solving skills and techniques, including logical thinking, creative design, synthesis and evaluation.  It also teaches generically useful skills in areas such as communication, time management, organization, and teamwork.

You can read the entire [Ontario Computer Studies Curriculum](http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/curriculum/secondary/computer10to12_2008.pdf) by visiting the Government of Ontario site.  The expectations identified for each course describe the knowledge and skills that students are expected to develop and demonstrate in their class work.

## ICS3U Curriculum - Assessment and Evaluation

The Ontario Ministry of Education document [Growing Success](chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/policyfunding/growsuccess.pdf) determines the rules and policies for measuring and communicating achievement in Grade 11 Computer Science

The primary purpose of assessment and evaluation in Grade 11 Computer Science is to improve student learning.  Information gathered through assessment helps teachers to determine students strengths and weaknesses in their achievement or the overall ICS3U curriculum expectations.

### Assessment in Computer Science

The process of assessing student learning is continuous and on-going. Teachers use information gathered through assessments to provide feedback for students, to guide instruction and develop individual learning goals for students. This is assessment for learning. Students use this feedback to continuously improve their achievement and set individual learning goals. This is assessment as learning. Information from assessments informs the teacher’s professional judgment, but is not used in determining the student’s level of achievement.

### Evaluation in ICS3U

Evaluation is the process of determining a level of student achievement of the Overall Expectations for a course, which is recorded as a mid-term or final grade on a report card. Students will be given numerous and varied opportunities to demonstrate their achievement of the Overall Expectations, as defined in the ICS3U curriculum, across the four categories of achievement (Knowledge & Understanding, Thinking, Communication and Application).  Evidence of student achievement of the Overall Expectations is collected over time from three different sources – observations, conversations and student products.

To be successful students must demonstrate achievement of EACH of the Overall Expectations for the course. If a student is missing evidence of achievement of one or more of the Overall Expectations then a lower limit will be determined by the teacher.

Here are the overall expectations for ICS3U Introduction to Grade 11 Computer Science

<details>
<summary>ICS3U Curriculum - Strand A - Programming Concepts and Skills</summary>

<h4>Overall ICS3U Curriculum Expectations</h4>

<li>D3 – Describe postsecondary education and career prospects related to computer studies
</ul>
</details>

### Report Card Grade

In determining a report card grade teachers use their professional judgment to interpret the evidence of student achievement which reflects the student’s most consistent level of achievement with special considerations given to the more recent evidence.

The final grade in this Grade 11 Computer Science course is determined by the following breakdown:

- 70 % – evaluations made at the end of units throughout the semester.

- 30% – final demonstrations of learning (culminating activities and/or final examinations)

All ICS3U assessments have been designed to meet the achievement chart categories in the Ontario ICS3U curriculum.

- **Knowledge and Understanding** – specific content acquired in the course and the comprehension of its meaning and significance.

- **Thinking** – The use of critical and creative thinking skills and processes.  It involves planning skills (focusing research, gathering information, selecting strategies, organizing a project).  Processing skills (analyzing, interpreting, assessing, reasoning, generating ideas, evaluating, synthesizing, seeking a variety of perspectives). Critical and creative thinking processes (problem solving, decision making, research)

- **Communication** – The conveying of meaning through various forms

- **Application** – The use of knowledge and skills to make connections within and between various contexts

The following are the Levels of Achievement for ICS3U:

- Level 4 (80% – 100%) Exceeds the provincial standard. The student demonstrates the specified knowledge and skills with a high degree of effectiveness.

- Level 3 (70% – 79%) The provincial standard for achievement. The student demonstrates the specified knowledge and skills with considerable effectiveness. Parents of students achieving at level 3 can be confident that their children will be prepared for work in subsequent grades/courses

- Level 2 (60% – 69%) Achievement that approaches the provincial standard. The student demonstrates the specified knowledge and skills with some effectiveness. Students performing at this level need to work on identified learning gaps to ensure future success.

- Level 1 (50% – 59%) Falls much below the provincial standard. The student demonstrates the specified knowledge and skills with limited effectiveness. Students must work at significantly improving learning in specific areas, as necessary, if they are to be successful in the next grade/course.
